## How to Process a Ticket

Follow this workflow for every ticket you handle:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review and categorize">
    When you receive a ticket:
    - Read all details carefully
    - Categorize the ticket type (CNR, Delay, Refund, etc.)
    - Add relevant tags for easy filtering
    - Assign priority based on issue severity and SLA
    - Set status to "Waiting on CX" to show you own it
    
    <Tip>
    Spend 2-3 minutes on proper categorization upfront. This helps with tracking, reporting, and finding similar cases later.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Investigate thoroughly">
    Before taking action:
    - Gather all relevant information from the ticket
    - Look up customer account and order history in Alpha Desk
    - Check order status in LULU (UK) or Falcon (UAE)
    - Review any previous tickets from this customer
    - Identify the root cause of the issue
    - Update status to "In Progress"
    
    <Check>
    Make sure you fully understand the issue before responding to the customer.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Take action">
    Implement the resolution:
    - Follow the appropriate procedure for the ticket type
    - Coordinate with other teams if needed (finance, operations, compliance)
    - Request additional information from customer if required
    - Update ticket status based on dependencies
    - Document every action you take with timestamps
    
    <Warning>
    Never make changes to orders or initiate refunds without proper verification and authorization.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Communicate with customer">
    Keep the customer informed:
    - Use the appropriate template as a starting point
    - Personalize the message with specific details
    - Set clear, realistic expectations for resolution time
    - Explain next steps in simple language
    - Offer alternative solutions if applicable
    - Provide your contact information for follow-up
    
    <Tip>
    Acknowledge any inconvenience caused, even if the issue wasn't Aspora's fault. Empathy builds trust.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Resolve and verify">
    Ensure the issue is fully resolved:
    - Complete all required actions
    - Verify the resolution in Alpha Desk
    - Confirm the customer received the expected outcome
    - Get customer confirmation that they're satisfied
    - Document the final outcome clearly
    - Update status to "Resolved"
    
    <Check>
    Don't mark as resolved until the customer confirms satisfaction or you've verified completion.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Close properly">
    Finalize the ticket:
    - Ensure all documentation is complete
    - Verify SLA was met (or exception documented)
    - Add any learnings to knowledge base
    - Close the ticket
    - Follow up if you promised additional information
    
    <Info>

  </Step>
</Steps>
