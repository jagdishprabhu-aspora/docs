## Decision Tree

Use this decision tree to determine the correct ticket category:

```
STEP 1 — Is it an onboarding issue?
→ Yes → Verification → EFR

STEP 2 — Has a Falcon payout been created?
→ No → Transaction Request Not Received

STEP 3 — Falcon payout created but still processing?
→ Yes → Transfer Delay (VDA >72 hrs / RDA >24 hrs)

STEP 4 — Falcon shows Completed?
→ Yes → Collect PDF → CNR

STEP 5 — Falcon shows Failed?
→ Refund initiated?
   No → Failed Refund Not Initiated
   Yes but user not received → Refund Completed, User Not Received
```
