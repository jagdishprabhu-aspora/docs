description: "Complete guide to UK and EUR transfer flow from initiation through completion, including TRM compliance, VDA, RDA, and failure handling"
---

## Overview

Understand the complete UK and EUR transfer flow structure from customer initiation through final completion. This guide covers TRM compliance checks, Falcon routing, VDA and RDA processing, UTR sharing, CNR handling, and failure scenarios.

<Info>
  UK and EUR flows follow the same structure. The processes are identical, with only regional differences in currency and specific compliance requirements.
</Info>

## 1. Transfer Initiation

<Card title="Transfer Initiation" icon="play">
  **What happens:**
  - User starts a transfer
  - The transaction goes through internal compliance (**TRM**) review
  
  **Your role:**
  - Verify the transfer was initiated correctly
  - Monitor for any immediate errors or blocks
</Card>

## 2. TRM Review

All UK and EUR transfers must pass TRM (Transaction Risk Management) compliance verification before proceeding to payout.

### If TRM Flags the Transaction

<Warning>
  If TRM flags the transaction, Aspora Compliance raises an RFI (Request for Information).
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Compliance raises RFI">
    Aspora Compliance team raises an RFI to the user.
    
    <Info>
    RFI notifications appear in the customer's app and require their response.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="User uploads documents">
    The user uploads the requested compliance documents through the app.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="User response outcomes">
    Based on user response:
    
    - **If user submits documents** → Transfer continues to processing
    - **If user fails to provide documents** → Transfer cancelled → Refund issued
    
    <Warning>
    If the user fails to provide requested documents, the transfer is automatically cancelled and refunded.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### If TRM Passes

<Check>
  If TRM passes without flags:
  - Transfer proceeds directly to payout processing
  - No additional action required from customer
  - Transfer continues to Falcon for routing
</Check>

## 3. Payout Processing (Falcon)

Once compliance checks pass, Falcon routes payouts via:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="VDA (Virtual Direct Account)" icon="credit-card">
    **Primary routing method**
    
    Faster processing, usually minutes to 24 hours
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="RDA (Remittance Direct Account)" icon="building-columns">
    **Fallback routing method**
    
    Used when VDA is unavailable or as backup
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Exact Same Handling as UAE

UK and EUR transfers follow the exact same handling as UAE for:

- **SLAs** - Same timeframes (VDA: up to 72 hours, RDA: up to 24 hours)
- **UTR sharing** - Same process for sharing transaction references
- **Delay ticketing** - Same ticket paths and procedures
- **CNR** - Same Customer Not Received handling
- **Reversals** - Same reversal and reprocessing procedures
- **Failure handling** - Same failure and refund processes

## 4. VDA Flow

### Standard Processing Time

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Normal Processing">
    - Usually **minutes to 24 hours**
    - Most transfers complete within this timeframe
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="warning" title="Extended Processing">
    - Can take up to **72 hours** in some cases
    - Still considered within normal parameters
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### If VDA Exceeds 72 Hours

<Steps>
  <Step title="Raise delay ticket">
    If VDA processing exceeds 72 hours, raise a ticket using this path:
    
    ```
    UK → Transfer Delay → VDA → Processing → Order ID → Falcon ID
    ```
    
    For EUR:
    ```
    EUR → Transfer Delay → VDA → Processing → Order ID → Falcon ID
    ```
    
    <Warning>
    Always include both Order ID and Falcon ID when raising delay tickets.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor resolution">
    Track the ticket and follow up with operations team if needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### After VDA Completes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Share UTR">
    Once VDA completes, share the **UTR (Unique Transaction Reference)** with the customer.
    
    <Info>
    UTR is the transaction reference number the customer can use to verify with their bank.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Ask customer to wait">
    Ask the user to wait **3 hours** for the funds to appear in their beneficiary's account.
    
    <Tip>
    Bank processing can take a few hours even after the transfer is complete.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="If funds not received after 3 hours">
    If funds are still not received after 3 hours:
    
    - Request **bank statement (PDF)** from the customer
    - Verify:
      - Beneficiary account number matches
      - UTR is present on the statement
    
    <Check>
    Always verify both account number and UTR before proceeding to CNR.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Raise CNR if needed">
    If still not reflecting after verification, raise CNR using the appropriate path (see Ticket Categorization guide).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 5. RDA Flow

### Standard Processing Time

<Card title="RDA Processing Time" icon="clock">
  **Up to 24 hours**
  
  RDA transfers typically complete within 24 hours of initiation.
</Card>

### If RDA Exceeds 24 Hours

<Steps>
  <Step title="Raise delay ticket">
    If RDA processing exceeds 24 hours, raise:
    
    ```
    UK → Transfer Delay → RDA → Processing → Order ID → Falcon ID
    ```
    
    For EUR:
    ```
    EUR → Transfer Delay → RDA → Processing → Order ID → Falcon ID
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor and follow up">
    Track the ticket and follow up with operations if delay persists.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### After RDA Completion

<Steps>
  <Step title="Share UTR">
    Share the **UTR** with the customer once RDA completes.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Ask to wait 3 hours">
    Ask customer to wait **3 hours** for funds to appear.

    - Request **PDF bank statement**
    - Verify account number and UTR
    - Raise CNR if needed using the appropriate path
  </Step>
</Steps>

### If Reversal Received

<Card title="RDA Reversal" icon="rotate-left">

</Card>

## 6. Falcon Failure Handling

### If Falcon Marks FAILED and Refund Not Initiated

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify refund status">
    Check if refund has been automatically initiated.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Raise failure ticket">
    If refund is not initiated, raise:
    
    ```
    UK → Failed / Refund Delay → Falcon failed refund not initiated → Order ID → Falcon ID
    ```
    
    For EUR:
    ```
    EUR → Failed / Refund Delay → Falcon failed refund not initiated → Order ID → Falcon ID
    ```
    
    <Warning>
    Always include both Order ID and Falcon ID for proper tracking.
    </Warning>

## Differences from UAE Flow

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="info" title="Compliance System">
    **UK/EUR:** Uses TRM (Transaction Risk Management) for compliance checks

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="check" title="Processing Times">
    **Same SLAs:**
    - VDA: Up to 72 hours
    - RDA: Up to 24 hours
    - Funds appearance: Up to 3 hours after UTR
    
    Processing times are identical across all regions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="file" title="Ticket Paths">
    **UK tickets:** Start with "UK →"
    
    **EUR tickets:** Start with "EUR →"
    
    **UAE tickets:** Start with "UAE →"
    
    All other paths are identical.
