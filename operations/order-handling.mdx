## Overview

Learn how to handle customer orders based on their current status in the system. You'll understand what each status means, what actions to take, and how to communicate clearly with customers about their order progress.

## United Kingdom

UK orders are primarily managed through the **LULU** system with specific sub-statuses indicating the order state.

### How to Handle UK Orders

Follow this workflow when a customer contacts you about a UK order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Look up the order">
    Search for the order in LULU system using the LR or LULU ID.
    
    <Tip>
    Ask the customer for their Order ID if they don't have the LULU reference number.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Identify the sub status">
    Check the specific sub status displayed (e.g., PAYMENT_PENDING, TXN_RELEASED, etc.).
    
    <Check>
    Verify you understand what this status means before communicating with the customer.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Take appropriate action">
    Follow the action items listed above for that specific status. Don't proceed to the next step until you've completed the required actions.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Communicate with customer">
    Explain the status and next steps to the customer using clear, non-technical language.
    
    <Warning>
    Never disclose specific AML or compliance rejection reasons. Use general terms like "additional review required."
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Document your actions">
    Log all actions taken in the ticket system, including what you checked, what you found, and what you told the customer.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## United Arab Emirates

UAE operations use the **Falcon** workflow system for both RDA (Remittance Direct Account) and VDA (Virtual Direct Account) orders.

### Falcon Workflows

<Info>
  Falcon workflows apply to both:
  - **RDA** - Remittance Direct Account transfers
  - **VDA** - Virtual Direct Account transfers
</Info>

### Processing and Refunds

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Automatic Refunds">
    **Certain order types trigger automatic refunds:**
    - Failed card transactions
    - Declined payments
    - System errors during processing
    
    **No manual intervention required** - System handles automatically
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Manual Refunds">
    **Operations team processes refunds for:**
    - Manual bank transfers
    - Compliance rejections
    - Customer-requested cancellations
    - Special cases requiring review
    
    **Requires team action** - Follow refund procedures
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Turnaround Time (TAT)

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="RDA Orders" icon="clock">
    **24 hours**
    
    Standard processing time for Remittance Direct Account orders
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="VDA Orders" icon="clock">
    **72 hours**
    
    Standard processing time for Virtual Direct Account orders
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  These are **maximum** turnaround times. Many orders process faster. Always aim to complete within or before these timeframes.
</Warning>

### How to Handle UAE Orders

Follow this workflow when assisting UAE customers:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Falcon dashboard">
    Open the order in Falcon system using the order ID.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Determine order type">
    Check if the order is RDA (24h TAT) or VDA (72h TAT).
    
    <Info>
    This determines the expected processing timeframe you'll communicate to the customer.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review workflow stage">
    Check the current stage in the Falcon workflow to understand where the order is in processing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify turnaround time">
    Calculate how long the order has been processing and compare against TAT:
    - RDA: Should complete within 24 hours
    - VDA: Should complete within 72 hours
    
    <Check>
    Use the order creation timestamp to calculate elapsed time accurately.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Take appropriate action">
    Based on your findings:
    
    - **Within TAT**: Continue monitoring and inform customer of expected completion time
    - **Approaching TAT (>75% elapsed)**: Prioritize and notify operations team proactively
    - **Exceeded TAT**: Escalate immediately to operations manager
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update the customer">
    Communicate the current status and realistic timeline based on your assessment.
    
    <Tip>
    Always set expectations slightly longer than the TAT to account for potential delays.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>
