## Payment Status Workflows

### Successful Payment Workflow

When everything goes smoothly, payments follow this path:

**Payment Pending → Payment Received → Payment Confirmed → Processing → Transferred to Beneficiary → Complete**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Payment Pending">
    Customer initiates the order and receives payment instructions.
    
    **Your role:** Verify customer received instructions and knows how to pay.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Payment Received">
    Aspora receives the customer's funds.
    
    **Your role:** Confirm payment receipt in Alpha Desk if customer inquires.
    
    <Check>
    You can see payment received status typically within 1-2 business days for manual transfers.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Payment Confirmed">
    Payment is verified and allocated to the order.
    
    **Your role:** Inform customer their payment is confirmed and processing will begin.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Processing">
    The order is being processed for transfer to the beneficiary.
    
    **Your role:** Provide expected completion timeframe based on region (UK: 24-48h, UAE RDA: 24h, UAE VDA: 72h).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Transferred to Beneficiary">
    Funds are sent to the recipient's account.
    
    **Your role:** Notify customer of successful transfer and provide transaction reference.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete">
    Transaction is fully completed.
    
    **Your role:** Confirm customer satisfaction and close the inquiry.
    
    <Check>
    Update ticket status to resolved after customer confirms receipt.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="message" title="Communicating Status">
    **Do:**
    - Use clear, non-technical language
    - Provide expected timelines
    - Set realistic expectations
    - Offer proactive updates
    
    **Don't:**
    - Use system codes without explanation
    - Promise specific times you can't guarantee
    - Disclose sensitive compliance details
    - Alarm customers unnecessarily
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Timing Expectations">
    **Set appropriate expectations:**
    - Manual transfers: 1-3 business days to confirm
    - Card payments: Minutes to hours
    - Reviews: 24-72 hours typically
    - Refunds: 3 working days (automatic) or 5-10 business days (manual)
    
    Always add buffer time in communications
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="sync" title="Status Monitoring">
    **Regular checks for:**
    - Payments pending over 48 hours
    - Reviews exceeding 72 hours
    - Failed payments needing follow-up
    - Refunds pending completion
    
    Proactive monitoring prevents escalations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="triangle-exclamation" title="When to Escalate">
    **Escalate immediately for:**
    - PAYMENT_PENDING status (system issue)
    - SARDINE_FAILURE_AWAIT_EXTERNAL_ACTION (requires dashboard action)
    - FAILED status without refund initiation
    - Any status persisting beyond expected SLA
    
    Don't wait - escalate proactively
