### Manual Intervention Process for UK & EUR

If a verification is pending and requires manual intervention, you need to raise a BO (Back Office) ticket.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check for existing ticket">
    Before creating a new BO ticket, always check whether one already exists for the same issue.
    
    <Warning>
    Duplicate tickets create confusion and slow down resolution. Always verify first.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create BO ticket">
    Create a new BO ticket using the following path:
    
    ```
    UK → Verification → Sumsub
    ```
    
    For EUR region, use:
    ```
    EUR → Verification → Sumsub
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Move parent ticket">
    Once the BO ticket is created, move the CX parent ticket to the **CX BO bin**.
