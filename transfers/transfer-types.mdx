### Manual Bank Transfer

<Card title="UK/EUR Manual Bank Transfer" icon="building-columns">
  **How it works:**

  - User initiates the transfer
  - User sends funds through their bank
  - Aspora receives and processes the transfer

  **Process details:**

  - Customer creates a transfer order in the Aspora app
  - System provides Aspora's bank details
  - Customer completes the bank transfer independently
  - Processing begins after you verify funds are received

  **When to recommend:**

  - For customers comfortable with online banking
  - When immediate processing isn't critical
  - For larger transfer amounts

  **Your role:**

  - Provide clear bank transfer instructions
  - Set expectations for 24-48 hour processing time
  - Follow up to confirm payment receipt
</Card>
