## US Banking Considerations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Business Days" icon="calendar">
    US banking operates on business days only.

    Transfers initiated on weekends or holidays may be delayed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Settlement Periods" icon="clock">
    Settlement periods vary by bank and transfer type.

    Some banks process faster than others.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Holidays" icon="calendar-check">
    US banking holidays affect processing.

    Always check holiday calendar when setting expectations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bank Maintenance" icon="wrench">
    Banks occasionally perform maintenance.

    This can temporarily delay connections or transfers.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  US transfers use a different flow than UK/EUR/UAE due to Plaid integration and US banking requirements. Always set realistic expectations based on US banking schedules and settlement periods.
