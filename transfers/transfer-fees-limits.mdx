### Fee Structure

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Fee Calculation" icon="calculator">

    Whichever is lower applies
  </Card>
  <Card title="Per Transfer Fee" icon="money-bill">
    **£5 per transfer**

    Applied to each transaction
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Transfer Limits

<Accordion title="Daily Limit" icon="calendar-day">
  **£400,000 per day**

  Maximum amount that can be transferred in a single day

  <Note>
    No restriction on the number of daily transfers
  </Note>
</Accordion>

### How to Calculate Fees

Use these examples when explaining fees to customers:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example 1: £1,000 Transfer" icon="calculator">
    **Calculation:**

    - Transfer Amount: £1,000
    - 0.3% of £1,000 = £3
    - **Total Fee: £3**
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Example 2: £5,000 Transfer" icon="calculator">
    **Calculation:**

    - Transfer Amount: £5,000
    - 0.3% of £5,000 = £15
    - Compare: £15 vs fixed £3 minimum
    - **Fee Applied: £3** (minimum applies) 
    - **Total Fee: £3**
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Always calculate both 0.3% and £3, then use whichever is lower. Add the £5 per-transfer fee to your final calculation.
</Tip>

## United Arab Emirates

### Fee Structure

<Card title="Transfer Fee" icon="tag">
  <div style={{ fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#16A34A' }}>FREE</div>
  <p>No fees charged on transfers</p>
</Card>

### Transfer Limits

<Accordion title="Daily Limit" icon="calendar-day">
  **AED 140,000 per day**

  Maximum cumulative amount for the day

  <Note>
    This limit applies to **single or multiple transfers** combined
  </Note>
</Accordion>

### Important: Cumulative Daily Limits

<Warning>
  **When explaining limits to UAE customers:**

  - The AED 140,000 limit is cumulative across all transfers
  - Example: If they transfer AED 70,000 in the morning, they can only transfer up to AED 70,000 more that day
  - Limits reset at midnight UAE time (GST)
  - Check their daily total in Alpha Desk before confirming large transfers
</Warning>

<Tip>
  If a customer needs to transfer more than AED 140,000, advise them to split the transfer across two days rather than attempting to bypass the limit.
</Tip>
